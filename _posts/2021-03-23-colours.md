title: Colouring by numbers
---

If you’ve seen glowing embers, frozen lakes or muddy leaves, you probably associate certain words with colours; “hot” and “cold” are red and blue, “ripe” and “unripe” are often green and black, “clean” and “dirty” are white and brown, and so on. But visual experience can’t explain why, when asked to describe things in terms of the rainbow, those born blind give much the same answers as the sighted.

What’s more, the blind have a good sense of colour relationships. [Asked to rate](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13506285.2018.1465148?journalCode=pvis20) the similarity of a pair of shades (eg red compared to orange, on a scale of 0-9), they can give answers consistent enough to reproduce a colour wheel, the same arrangement Newton first derived from his experiments with prisms.

A [recent working paper](https://psyarxiv.com/vyxpq/) may help explain their surprising chromatic insight. The authors found that they could recover these same word associations from an analysis of written text. The study asked whether humans, sighted or not, might learn colourful connotations from language as well as from visual experience.

The key was a technique, known as word embedding, which can discern a word’s meaning from the way it is used – as opposed to an explicit definition. The idea is that words are defined by the company they keep. “Furry”, for example, tends to appear near words like “cat”, “bunny” and “hair”, giving an idea of what it represents. “Fluffy” appears in similar contexts, suggesting an overlapping meaning.

To see how computers can exploit this idea, imagine pinning thousands of words at random over a cork board. When two show up in similar sentences in a source text, an algorithm moves them closer on the board. Eventually, interchangeable terms are pinned together; those that coincide rarely (and so have very different meanings) are remote.

Words can be similar in some ways, yet different in others. “Hot” and “cold” might be distant on the board horizontally (because they are antonyms) but nearby vertically (both being thermal). Researchers use a pinboard with more than two dimensions – often around 500 – so that words can be discriminated in multiple ways. For example, drawing a line from “man” to “woman” gives a direction for gender. Starting at “king” and following that same line results in “queen”. The meaning of the royal titles overlaps with that of gender terms, and the embeddings show how they are connected.

## The Colour Out of (Vector) Space

The same trick applies to colours and adjectives. You just have to [find the relevant direction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01241) for a pair like hot/cold, and see where colour words turn up (see graphic). Refracting colours across adjective pairs like exciting/dull, selfless/jealous and relaxed/tense in this way revealed arrangements that lined up with both blind and sighted survey answers.

Repeating the experiment with different sources of text, the algorithm’s results were most human-like when it had access to fiction. Sentences with particularly vivid objects (eg embers, both red and hot, or bananas, both ripe and yellow) boosted the result, suggesting they were the main route for colours and adjectives to become linked.

Despite this evidence, the authors didn’t find that bookworms feel stronger associations. But if they learned those associations from reading, the (literate and well-educated) students surveyed may already have been saturated.

Reading fiction is not the only way the blind could learn about colour; a handful in an earlier study had reviewed the spectrum in science lessons. Yet language must play a part, and word embeddings can untangle meaning that speakers take for granted. Such studies may illuminate how black-and-white text can convey sensory experiences. A picture may be worth a thousand words – but those words are no less vibrant.
