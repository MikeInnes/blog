## Some things you should know

* My name is Mike
* I know very little about anything (but I'm working on it)
* As a programmer, I spend most of my time writing pieces of text which solve problems
  * Although the problems are often caused by other pieces of text, which were often also written by me

## Some things I've worked on

* [Julia](https://julialang.org/), a fast programming language
* [Rel](https://relational.ai), a datalog with probabilistic programming
* [Flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux_(machine-learning_framework)) and [Zygote](https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl), machine learning systems
* [Juno](http://junolab.org), a live-coding IDE (now [Julia VS Code](https://www.julia-vscode.org))
* [Miscellaneous open-source projects](https://github.com/MikeInnes/)
